<h1 align="center">Kanban Web App</h1>

## :memo: Description
A kanban board is a tool that can be used to manage work at a personal or organizational level. It visually depicts work at various stages of a process using cards to represent work items and columns to represent each stage of the process. The app allows the user to manage the workflow of a project. The design was provided by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/kanban-task-management-web-app-wgQLt-HlbB).
